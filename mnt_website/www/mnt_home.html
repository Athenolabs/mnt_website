							"Most ERP systems charge upfront for installing or subscriptions. In case of ERPNext, there is no charge for trying out the system as-is. You can try out the system either on the ERPNext cloud, or on a server of your own, with the right technical know-how. <br />Once you have started evaluating the system or using it day-to-day in your organization, you can identify gaps for customization needed for your specific business processes. Once such gaps have been identified, you can choose one of the following options:
							<ul>
								<li>If the features needed to fill the gaps are generic, you can approach Frappe Technologies for additions to features to ERPNext and pay for the development.</li>
								<li>If ERPNext fits well everywhere else in your organization and your requirement is organization specific, such that addition to core ERPNext is not possible, service providers like us can help you customize or develop the system.</li>

		{{- render_question("How does MN Technique charge?", 
		    						"The general pricing equation in ERP space is License + Modifications. As ERPNext is available without any licensing fee, our charges for modifications need to focus on delivering value, so that total cost of ownership (TCO) stays significantly lower than other ERP options.<br />To begin with, a client's requirements are divided into Development Activities and Support Activities. We submit a time estimate for these activities which helps the client to identify the cost of ERPNext Implementation. <br /> We send time-logs (hours spent on identified task) of work done periodically and raise invoices based on these time logs.") -}}
